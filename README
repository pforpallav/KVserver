Current State:
A simple socket connection is established between the server and the client. There is no threading, so there is only one client to server connection possible. Currently, only a live mapping of key-values is maintained. As long the server is running, the pairing is alive.

Work to be Done:
Get a threaded server, that could serve multiple clients at a time (if possible). Make things more robust. Make the pairing permanent.

src:
KVserver.go - The server executable that accepts connection from a client. Only recognises "GET", "PUT", "DEL" for now.
KVclient.go - The client executable that validates and transfers commands to the server.

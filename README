Current State:
A simple socket connection is established between the server and the client. There is no threading, so there is only one client to server connection possible. I still on deciding how to implement the key-database.

src:
KVserver.go - The server that accepts connection from a client. Only recognises "GET", "PUT", "DEL" for now.
KVclient.go - The client that just transfers the standard input to the server.
